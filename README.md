# **Crime Data Analysis - Data Warehousing and Power BI**
### CITS3401: Data Warehousing Project | The University of Western Australia

**Objective:**  
This project aims to design and implement a **data warehouse** that supports analytical queries for crime data. It involves building **ETL pipelines**, designing a **star schema**, and creating **Power BI visualisations** to find insights from the transformed data.  

---

## Project Overview  
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of **data warehousing and business intelligence**, from data extraction to visual reporting.  
It includes:  
- Data cleaning and transformation using SQL and Python.  
- Loading data into a relational model optimised for analytics.  
- Star schema and ER diagram design for efficient query performance.  
- Power BI dashboard for exploratory data visualisation.

## Methodology Summary
### 1. Data Extraction and Transformation (ETL)
- Extracted raw CSV files into SQL Server.  
- Cleaned and transformed datasets using SQL scripts and Python for data type conversion, deduplication, and normalisation.  
- Created **fact** and **dimension** tables aligned with analytical requirements.  

### 2. Data Modeling
- Designed a **Star Schema** for analytical performance.  
- Built **ER diagrams** and **StarNet diagrams** to define table relationships.  
- Defined hierarchies and aggregation levels for analysis  

### 3. Visualisation and Reporting
- Integrated the warehouse with **Power BI** to visualise metrics and trends.  
- Developed a multi-page interactive dashboard for decision support and storytelling.

## Results & Insights
- Successfully implemented a working data warehouse that supports multidimensional analytics.  
- Power BI dashboard enables dynamic filtering and drill-down analysis by crime type, time, and region.  
- ETL process automated the data refresh pipeline.  
- Identified key crime patterns and high-risk areas for deeper policy analysis.

## Room for Improvement  
- **Automation:** Future versions could implement a scheduled ETL workflow when real-time data is available.
- **Scalability:** Migrating to a cloud warehouse would improve scalability.
